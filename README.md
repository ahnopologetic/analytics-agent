# Tracking Agent
- Goal
	- Make Analytics Greater
- Feature
	- Tracking Plan Generation
		- Configure and connect your github repos
		- Scan through your repos, find existing event tracking including what event name and properties are tracking and its context (e.g., Triggers when user clicks submit button)
		- Generate a table of tracking plan that includes name, properties, tags/categories, location, platform (e.g., web, app, server, etc)
	- Tracking Plan Implementation
		- Based on your generated or imported tracking plan, add analytics code to your repo. 
	- Import Figma, auto generate tracking plan screen by screen
- TODO
	- Analyze seagoat
		- How does it work? 
		- How does it convert codebase to make it searchable? 
	- Implementation Idea
		- On top of cursor, IDEs
			- VScode compatible extension? 
- Idea/Scratchnote
	- Now semantic code search is generally available. Can I just use it? 
	- Or should I just implement RAG from codebase?
